## Why another rhythm game?

Cause osu!mania kinda sucks in a lot of ways but I think hold-style and SV-style charts are still worthwhile.
Interlude aims to combine all the good out of similar keyboard games like Stepmania/Etterna/osu!mania/Quaver/LR2. Quaver has similar goals but I believe their difficulty calculator will suffer identical issues to star rating.

## Features
+ Support for skins/themes to customise noteskins, interface layout and some other stuff
+ Ability to convert charts from .osu (osu!mania) and .sm (Stepmania/Etterna)
+ Work in progress automatic chart difficulty calculator that gives you a performance rating and stores your scores - Read about how it works [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sW1OGfcRdu8UL1duk66vNv96GaDKCUef5YrrpmZhMNs/edit)
+ New performance can be recalculated from old scores when the calculator is updated
+ Support for hold note styled charts, slider velocities in charts and mines in charts
+ Accuracy and Life systems can be customised to simulate any game you can see what you would've got in other games on the fly
+ Support for keymodes 3-10
+ Column-independent scroll speed changes
+ Rates - Speeding up or slowing down a chart to suit your skill level
+ Upscroll and Downscroll both supported, as well as screencovers
+ Collections/tools to organise charts
+ Ingame downloading and importing via etternaonline.com

## Planned features..
+ An automatic difficulty calculator that beats all others
+ A fully featured chart editor
+ BMS support with (optional) scratch lanes
+ Online score servers/leaderboards
+ Regular/weekly challenges for players to complete
